# Stats key resources

A personal go-to list of stats resources.

I curate this list with **key** refs with conceptual and 'user guides' by different stats approaches. It is not an exhaustive list by topic.

You're welcome to contribute and share it if you like it. 

If you'd like to suggest a key ref I may have missed (super likely), feel free to open a issue/pull request, or contact me by email at <nicholaswdaudt@gmail.com>, and/or find me on Twitter [@NWDaudt](https://twitter.com/NWDaudt).

PS -- this is a work in progress :)
